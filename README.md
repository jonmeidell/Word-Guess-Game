# Castlevania Hangman game
![Welcome!](https://jonmeidell.github.io/Castlehangia-Man/assets/images/gameover.jpg)

Uses Javascript to have random words chosen.  Displays an associated picture of the word guessed once completed.  Keeps track of wins and losses accumulated throughout the session playthrough; (session will clear out after site is left or refreshed).

#### Improvements to be made:
  * getting the word box into the desired location on screen
  * showing the associated picture to the side of the word box rather than below
  * resizing of the images
