# Castlevania Hangman game
![Welcome!](https://jonmeidell.github.io/Castlehangia-Man/assets/images/gameover.jpg)

### How to play:

**You have 10 guesses to find the Castlevania-themed word!**  The game keeps track and shows the letters already guessed, and how many guesses are left.  You can choose a new word at any time by pressing the **New word** button.

#### Technical aspects:

_Uses Javascript to have random words chosen.  Resizes and displays an associated picture of the word guessed once completed.  Keeps track of wins and losses accumulated throughout the session playthrough; (session will clear out after site is left or refreshed)._

#### Improvements to be made:
  * _getting the word box into the desired location on screen_
    * try to get box and picture area to be centered on page
